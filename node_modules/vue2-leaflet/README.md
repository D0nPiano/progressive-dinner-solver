[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/KoRiGaN/Vue2Leaflet/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/KoRiGaN/Vue2Leaflet?branch=master)

Vue2Leaflet is a JavaScript library for the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework that wraps [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) making it easy to create reactive maps.

## How to install

``` bash
npm install vue2-leaflet leaflet --save
```

For more detailed information you can follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://korigan.github.io/Vue2Leaflet/#/quickstart.md)

## Breaking change from 1.x.x to 2.x.x

A new major release 2.0,0 is available and come with one breaking change:

### Leaflet is not automatically installed anymore

Leaflet is now a peerDependency and need to be installed manually, we updated our docs to reflect this but please pay attention when migrating

### Importing the library in Webpack / Rollup

Now the code of vue2-leaflet is split component by component (while using a bundler like Webpack/Rollup/Parcel) to do so the following syntax is not working anymore:

```javascript
import Vue2Leaflet from 'vue2-leaflet' // INVALID
```

And has been replaced by

```javascript
import * as Vue2Leaflet from 'vue2-leaflet' // VALID
```

Is highly suggested to import only the needed modules by doing so:

```javascript
import {LMap, LTileLayer, LMarker} from 'vue2-leaflet'
```

This will reduce the size of the bundle significantly

If you want to hack around, here is a [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/Boumi/k04zpLx9/) to get started

If you have created a plugin and want it to be listed here, let me know :-).

Vue2Leaflet is only a wrapper for Leaflet. I want to keep it as simple as possible so I don't want to add any plugin support into this repo.
